The README file for Guile Curses

This is gucu v0.6, the curses library from the Gano project.  It
provides functionality to allow programs written in Guile to interact
with character screens in a terminal-independent manner.  It is a
wrapper to the underlying curses library.

This library can be found at http://gano.sourceforge.net

It is known to work on the following systems

CYGWIN_NT-6.1 1.5.23 on i68 with Guile 1.8.2 and NCurses 5.7.x
Fedora 12 with Guile 1.8.7 and NCurses 5.7.20090207

It also sort of works on
 
OpenBSD 4.5 i386 with Guile 1.6.7 and its default libncurses, but make
check fails unnecessarily.

This distribution has the following subdirectories:
- gucu: the source code for the library
- test: test scripts to verify that the library functions correctly
- doc: documentation for the library source to generate it
- build_aux: files used by the configuration and building programs
- tools: some executable programs that might be useful

For an explanation of the installation of the package, see the INSTALL
file.
