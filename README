This is GNU Guile-Ncurses v2.0.  It provides functionality to allow
programs written in the GNU Guile interpreter of the Scheme
programming language to interact with character screens in a
terminal-independent manner.  It is a wrapper to the underlying
ncurses library.

This library can be found at http://www.gnu.org/software/guile-ncurses/

It can be compiled either using 8-bit characters or Unicode characters.
Unicode characters are the default, but, it requires Guile 2.0.x,
and a version of Ncurses compiled with wide characters enabled.

It probably requires a version of Guile >= 2.0.11 and a version of
Ncurses >= 6.0. Earlier releases of Guile or Ncurses have not been tested.

It would likely take little modification to work on Guile 1.8.8, but,
support for Guile 1.8 is not longer being maintained.

It builds on version 24 of the Fedora distribution of GNU/Linux operating
systems, and will likely build on most recent distributions of GNU/Linux.

For more information on the current state of the build on Cygwin or
MinGW, see README.cygwin or README.mingw respectively.

This distribution has the following subdirectories:
- src: the source code for the library
- test: test scripts to verify that the library functions correctly
- doc: documentation for the library source to generate it
- build_aux: files used by the configuration and building programs
- tools: some executable programs that might be useful

INSTALLATION

For a basic explanation of the installation of the package, see the
INSTALL file.

*important* If you want to use the narrow ncurses library with only
8-bit character support, you need to run configure using the
"--without-ncursesw" option.

*important* You probably want to call configure with the
"--with-guilesitedir" option so that this package is installed in
Guile's default path.  But, if you don't know where your Guile site
directory is, run "configure" without the option, and it will give you
a suggestion.

For an explanation of the copying restrictions for this package, see
COPYING.LESSER.
