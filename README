This is GNU Guile-Ncurses v1.6.  It provides functionality to allow
programs written in the GNU Guile interpreter of the Scheme
programming language to interact with character screens in a
terminal-independent manner.  It is a wrapper to the underlying
ncurses library.

This library can be found at http://www.gnu.org/software/guile-ncurses/

It can be compiled either using 8-bit characters or Unicode characters.

The Unicode-enabled version is known to work on the following system:

  Fedora 20 on i686-pc-linux-gnu with Guile 2.0.11, Libunistring
    0.9.3, and NCursesW 5.9.20130511

The 8-bit version is known to work on the following systems

  Cygwin 1.7.32 on i686-pc-cygwin with Guile 1.8.7 and NCurses 5.9.20140524
  MinGW version MINGW32_NT-6.1 on i686 with Guile 1.8.8 and Ncurses 5.9.20140920
  OpenBSD 5.5 on i386 with Guile 1.8.8 and NCurses 5.7.20081102

This distribution has the following subdirectories:
- ncurses: the source code for the library
- test: test scripts to verify that the library functions correctly
- doc: documentation for the library source to generate it
- build_aux: files used by the configuration and building programs
- tools: some executable programs that might be useful

INSTALLATION

For a basic explanation of the installation of the package, see the
INSTALL file.

*important* If you want to use the wide ncurses library with Unicode
support, you need to run configure using the "--with-ncursesw" option.

*important* You probably want to call configure with the
"--with-guilesitedir" option so that this package is installed in
Guile's default path.  But, if you don't know where your Guile site
directory is, run "configure" without the option, and it will give you
a suggestion.

For an explanation of the copying restrictions for this package, see
COPYING.LESSER.
