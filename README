This is GNU Guile-Ncurses v1.5.  It provides functionality to allow
programs written in the Guile interpreter to interact with character
screens in a terminal-independent manner.  It is a wrapper to the
underlying ncurses library.

This library can be found at http://www.gnu.org/software/guile-ncurses/

It can be compiled either using 8-bit characters or Unicode characters.

The Unicode-enabled version is know to work on the following system:

  Fedora 14 on i686-pc-linux-gnu with Guile 1.9.14, Libunistring
    0.1.2, and NCursesW 5.7.20100703

The 8-bit version is known to work on the following systems

  Fedora 14 on i686-pc-linux-gnu with Guile 1.9.14 and NCurses 5.7.20100703
  Cygwin 1.7.32 on i686-pc-cygwin with Guile 1.8.7 and NCurses 5.9.20140524

This distribution has the following subdirectories:
- ncurses: the source code for the library
- test: test scripts to verify that the library functions correctly
- doc: documentation for the library source to generate it
- build_aux: files used by the configuration and building programs
- tools: some executable programs that might be useful

INSTALLATION

For a basic explanation of the installation of the package, see the
INSTALL file.

*important* If you want to use the wide ncurses library with Unicode
support, you need to run configure using the "--with-ncursesw" option.

*important* You probably want to call configure with the
"--with-guilesitedir" option so that this package is installed in
Guile's default path.  But, if you don't know where your Guile site
directory is, run "configure" without the option, and it will give you
a suggestion.

For an explanation of the copying restrictions for this package, see
COPYING.LESSER.
