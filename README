$Id: README,v 1.5 2009/01/18 07:01:11 spike_gran Exp $


This is gucu v0.3, the curses library from the Gano project.  It
provides functionality to allow programs written in Guile to interact
with character screens in a terminal-independent manner.  It is a
wrapper to the underlying curses library.

This library can be found at http://gano.sourceforge.net .

This distribution has the following subdirectories:
- src: the source code for the library
- test: test scripts to verify that the library functions correctly
- doc: documentation for the library source to generate it
- build_aux: files used by the configuration and building programs
- tools: some executable programs that might be useful

For an explanation of the installation of the package, see the INSTALL
file.
