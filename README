This is GNU Guile-Ncurses v0.9.  It provides functionality to allow
programs written in the Guile interpreter to interact with character
screens in a terminal-independent manner.  It is a wrapper to the
underlying ncurses library.

This library can be found at http://www.gnu.org/software/guile-ncurses/

Fedora 13 on i686-pc-linux-gnu with Guile 1.9.11 and NCurses 5.7.20100130
cygwin 1.7.7 on i686-pc-cygwin with Guile 1.9.11 and NCurses 5.7.20091227
