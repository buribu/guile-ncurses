This is GNU Guile-Ncurses v2.0.  It provides functionality to allow
programs written in the GNU Guile interpreter of the Scheme
programming language to interact with character screens in a
terminal-independent manner.  It is a wrapper to the underlying
ncurses library.

This library can be found at http://www.gnu.org/software/guile-ncurses/

It provides bindings for most of the ncurses ecosystem. The base
ncurses library is for creating simple text applications. The
panels library adds the idea of overlapping panels.  The menu library
add widgets for selecting from a list.  The forms library adds widgets
for creating more complex text entry.

It also provides some bindings for the low-level termios library, which
is for manipulating the characteristics of terminal interfaces.

Depending on how it is compiled, Guile-Ncurses will use either the
"narrow" versions of the ncurses libraries, which only handles 8-bit
locales like ASCII or Latin1, or the "wide" version of the ncurses
libraries, which can handle UTF-8 locales.

A version of Guile >= 2.0.11 and a version of Ncurses >= 6.0 is
preferred. Earlier releases of Guile or Ncurses have not been tested.

For more information on the current state of the build on Cygwin,
MinGW or Openbsd, see README.cygwin or README.mingw or README.openbsd
respectively.

This distribution has the following subdirectories:
- src: the source code for the library
- test: test scripts to verify that the library functions correctly
- doc: documentation for the library source to generate it
- build_aux: files used by the configuration and building programs
- m4: more files used by the configuration process
- tools: some executable programs that might be useful

INSTALLATION

For a basic explanation of the installation of the package, see the
INSTALL file.

*important* If you want to use the narrow ncurses library with only
8-bit character support, you need to run configure using the
"--without-ncursesw" option.

*important* You probably want to call configure with the
"--with-guilesitedir" option so that this package is installed in
Guile's default path.  But, if you don't know where your Guile site
directory is, run "configure" without the option, and it will give you
a suggestion.

For an explanation of the copying restrictions for this package, see
COPYING.LESSER.
