The README file for Guile Curses

This is gucu v0.7, the ncurses library from the Gano project.  It
provides functionality to allow programs written in Guile to interact
with character screens in a terminal-independent manner.  It is a
wrapper to the underlying ncurses library.

This library can be found at http://gano.sourceforge.net

It is known to work on the following systems

CYGWIN_NT-6.1 1.7.5 on i686 with Guile 1.8.2 and NCurses 5.7.x
Fedora 12 with Guile 1.8.7 and NCurses 5.7.20090207
Fedora 21 with Guile 1.9.10 and NCurses 5.7.20090207

Previous versions worked on OpenBSD 4.5 i386 with Guile 1.6.7 and its
default libncurses, but make check fails unnecessarily.  This version
hasn't been checked on OpenBSD.

This distribution has the following subdirectories:
- gucu: the source code for the library
- test: test scripts to verify that the library functions correctly
- doc: documentation for the library source to generate it
- build_aux: files used by the configuration and building programs
- tools: some executable programs that might be useful
