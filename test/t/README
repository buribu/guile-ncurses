The file testxterm in this subdirectory is a copy of the xterm file
from the terminfo package distributed at ftp.invisible-island.net.  It
is a binary file that is generated from the terminfo.src file that
is found there.  Terminfo.src has the following (legendary) copyright
statement.

######## TERMINAL TYPE DESCRIPTIONS SOURCE FILE
#
# This version of terminfo.src is distributed with ncurses and is maintained
# by Thomas E. Dickey (TD).
#
# Report bugs and new terminal descriptions to

#
# The original header is preserved below for reference.  It is noted that there
# is a "newer" version which differs in some cosmetic details (but actually
# stopped updates several years ago); we have decided to not change the header
# unless there is also a change in content.
#
# To further muddy the waters, it is noted that changes to this file as part of
# maintenance of ncurses (since 1996) are generally conceded to be copyright
# under the ncurses MIT-style license.  That was the effect of the agreement
# which the principal authors of ncurses made in 1998.  However, since much of
# the file itself is of unknown authorship (and the disclaimer below makes it
# obvious that Raymond cannot or will not convey rights over those parts),
# there is no explicit copyright notice on the file itself.
#
# It would also be a nuisance to split the file into unknown/known authorship
# and move pieces as they are maintained, since many of the maintenance changes
# have been small corrections to Raymond's translations to/from termcap format,
# correcting the data but not the accompanying annotations.
#
# In any case, note that almost half of this file is not data but annotations
# which reflect creative effort.  Furthermore, the structure of entries to
# reuse common chunks also is creative (and subject to copyright).  Finally,
# some portions of the data are derivative work under a compatible MIT-style
# license from xterm.

# COPYRIGHTS AND OTHER DELUSIONS
#
# The BSD ancestor of this file had a standard Regents of the University of
# California copyright with dates from 1980 to 1993.
#
# Some information has been merged in from a terminfo file SCO distributes.
# It has an obnoxious boilerplate copyright which I'm ignoring because they
# took so much of the content from the ancestral BSD versions of this file
# and didn't attribute it, thereby violating the BSD Regents' copyright.
#
# Not that anyone should care.  However many valid functions copyrights may
# serve, putting one on a termcap/terminfo file with hundreds of anonymous
# contributors makes about as much sense as copyrighting a wall-full of
# graffiti -- it's legally dubious, ethically bogus, and patently ridiculous.
#
# This file deliberately has no copyright.  It belongs to no one and everyone.
# If you claim you own it, you will merely succeed in looking like a fool.
# Use it as you like.  Use it at your own risk.  Copy and redistribute freely.
# There are no guarantees anywhere.  Svaha!
